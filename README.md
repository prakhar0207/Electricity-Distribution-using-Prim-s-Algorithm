# Electricity-Distribution-using-Prim-s-Algorithm
The Electricity Distribution System using Prim's Algorithm is a project aimed at designing  an efficient and cost-effective system for distributing electricity. The distribution of  electricity is a critical component of modern society, and the development of an optimal  distribution system can have significant benefits in terms of cost savings
