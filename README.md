# Electricity-Distribution-using-Prim-s-Algorithm
The Electricity Distribution System using Prim's Algorithm is a project aimed at designing  an efficient and cost-effective system for distributing electricity. The distribution of  electricity is a critical component of modern society, and the development of an optimal  distribution system can have significant benefits in terms of cost savings 
The project will use Prim's Algorithm, a well-known algorithm in computer science, to 
develop a minimum spanning tree of the distribution network. The algorithm works by 
selecting a node as the root node and then adding the lowest-cost edge that connects the 
root node to any other node. The algorithm continues to add edges with the lowest cost 
until all the nodes are connected in a single tree. 
After developing the minimum spanning tree, the system will be optimized to ensure that 
each consumer is supplied with power from the nearest substation. This optimization will 
be achieved by calculating the shortest distance between each consumer and the 
substations and assigning the consumer to the nearest substation. The optimization will 
enhance the efficiency of the system and reduce power loss due to long cable distances. 
The system's performance will be evaluated using various metrics such as the cost of 
laying cables, the reliability of power supply, and the efficiency of the distribution system. 
The performance of the system will be tested using simulation and actual data, and the 
results will be compared with those of existing distribution systems.
